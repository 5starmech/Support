### Instructions to Enter BIOS Settings and Change Power Settings on a Dell

Follow these steps to configure your Dell to start automatically when power is restored:

---

#### **Step 1: Power on the Computer and Enter the BIOS**

1. **Turn off the computer completely.**
   
   - If the computer is already on, shut it down properly or hold the power button until it turns off.

2. **Turn the computer back on and press the BIOS key repeatedly as soon as the Dell logo appears.**
   
   - The default key for Dell Inspiron systems is typically `F2`.
   
   - If `F2` does not work, try one of these alternative keys commonly used by other systems:
     
     - `F1`   
     - `F10`     
     - `F12`
     - `Esc`
     - `Delete`     

> **Tip:** Press the key repeatedly and quickly during startup to ensure the system enters the BIOS. If the system boots into the operating system, restart and try again.

#### **Step 3: Enable Auto Power On After Power Loss**

1. In the Power Management section, look for an option similar to:
   - **AC Power Recovery**
   - **After Power Loss**
2. Select this option using the arrow keys and press `Enter`.
3. Change the setting to:
   - **Power On** (or a similar option that ensures the system turns on automatically when power is restored).
4. Press `Enter` to confirm the change.

#### **Step 4: Save and Exit the BIOS**

1. Press the `Esc` key or navigate to the **Exit** tab using the arrow keys.

The computer will restart, and the changes will take effect.
